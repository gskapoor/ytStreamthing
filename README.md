# Currently Unnamed Youtube Playlist Project

This project is intended to be a nodeJS + REACT project. Here is what I need (in order)

- [ ] get a working nodeJS playlist adder
- [ ] start a basic (REACT) UI for this nodeJS project
- [ ] profit?????

## How To Run This Project

To run this (for now at least), you need to ask for an authorization key from me (or need to get your own from Google's API services).
There is no UI component for now (maybe I'll use REACT in the future), but it runs fine in the command line with `npm start:dev`.
